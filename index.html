      <h2>Customer Story</h2>
      <p style="font-style: italic">“Before Cyber Guardians, cybersecurity training always felt overwhelming for our team. As a small retail business, we didn’t have time for long workshops or expensive programs. Cyber Guardians changed everything — the training is quick, practical, and even a bit of fun. Within weeks, our staff were spotting phishing emails they would have missed before. The real-time tracking also made it easy for us to see improvements across the whole team. It’s been one of the best investments we’ve made in protecting our business.”</p>
